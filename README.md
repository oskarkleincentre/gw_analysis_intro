To begin, clone the repository to your local machine. Then create a new virtual environment with:
```
conda create -n gw_analysis
conda activate gw_analysis
pip install gwpy pycbc lalsuite
conda install jupyter
```

Then launch the jupyter notebook and proceed through the examples and exercises.

There is redundant API between some of the packages, meaning that there is more than one way to complete
many of the same tasks. However, we will only be focusing on 3 of the most commonly used GW software packages:
